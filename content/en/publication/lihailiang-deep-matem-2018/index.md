abstract: "With the rapid increasing of published material science literatures, an effective literature retrieving system is important for researchers to obtain relevant information. In this paper we propose a cross-modal material science literatures retrieval method using transmission electron microscopy(TEM) image as query information, which provide a access of using material experiment generated TEM image data to retrieve literatures. In this method, terminologies are extracted and topic distribution are inferred from text part of literatures by using LDA, and we design a multi-task Convolutional Neuron Network(CNN) mapping query TEM image to the relevant terminologies and topic distribution predictions. The ranking score is calculated from output for query image and text data. Experimental results shows our method achieves better performance than multi-label CCA, Deep Semantic Matching(Deep SM) and Modality-Specific Deep Structure(MSDS)."
