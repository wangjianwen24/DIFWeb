abstract: "In this paper, a new, simple but effective method is proposed for blind image steganalysis, which is based on run-length histogram analysis. Higher-order statistics of characteristic functions of three types of image run-length histograms are selected as features. Support vector machine is used as classifier. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms prior arts in detection accuracy and generality. Â© 2008 IEEE."
