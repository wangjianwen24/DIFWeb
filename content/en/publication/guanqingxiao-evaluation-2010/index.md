abstract: "In past several years so many feature sets for steganalysis were proposed to detect stego images. These features based on different ideas and were considered to be effective for most steganography schemes. However a systematically comparison of these features have not been made in previous papers. In order to get a view of performance of current features in state of art, we designed several experiment to make a evaluation of them. Experiment result and conclusions draw from it were proposed in this paper. Â© 2010 IEEE."
