 abstract = {Self-embedding watermarking can be used for image tampering recovery. In this work, the authors proposed a new image self-embedding scheme based on optimal iterative block truncation coding and non-uniform watermark sharing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve better performance of tampering recovery than some of state-of-The-Art schemes.},
