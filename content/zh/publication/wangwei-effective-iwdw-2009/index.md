abstract: "A color image splicing detection method based on gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) of thresholded edge image of image chroma is proposed in this paper. Edge images are generated by subtracting horizontal, vertical, main and minor diagonal pixel values from current pixel values respectively and then thresholded with a predefined threshold T. The GLCMs of edge images along the four directions serve as features for image splicing detection. Boosting feature selection is applied to select optimal features and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is utilized as classifier in our approach. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been demonstrated by our experimental results. Â©2009 IEEE."
