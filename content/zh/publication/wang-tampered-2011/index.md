abstract: "With the availability of various digital image edit tools, seeing is no longer believing. In this paper, we focus on tampered region localization for image forensics. We propose an algorithm which can locate tampered region(s) in a lossless compressed tampered image when its unchanged region is output of JPEG decompressor. We find the tampered region and the unchanged region have different responses for JPEG compression. The tampered region has stronger high frequency quantization noise than the unchanged region. We employ PCA to separate different spatial frequencies quantization noises, i.e. low, medium and high frequency quantization noise, and extract high frequency quantization noise for tampered region localization. Post-processing is involved to get final localization result. The experimental results prove the effectiveness of our proposed method."
