 abstract = {Most of the quantization based watermarking algorithms are very sensitive to valumetric distortions, while these distortions are regarded as common processing in audio/video analysis. In recent years, watermarking methods which can resist this kind of distortions have attracted a lot of interests. But still many proposed methods can only deal with one certain kind of valumetric distortion as amplitude scaling, and fail in other kinds of valumetric distortions like constant change attack or gamma correction. In this paper, we propose a very simple method to tackle all the three kinds of valumetric distortions. A constant change invariant domain is first constructed by spread transform, in which the watermark is embedded using a certain amplitude scaling invariant based watermarking scheme. Several typical watermarking methods and attacks have been implemented in our experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},
